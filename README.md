#  Apple AppStore and Google Play analysis

## Proposed Solution:

Our purpose is to analyze the two largest mobile app stores in terms of respective statistical features and their similarities and differences. Some traditional statistical features are extracted by evaluating the correlation between two attributes or how one factor influences another using analysis of variance. By comparing the two app stores, we are able to explore the underlying discrepancies in operating system. We propose adopting permutation test to see if there is any significant difference in some statistics. E.g. Does Apple AppStore having higher average score in game apps means that IOS version games are really better? All the results will be visualized in a decent form for presentation.


### Dataset

Two datasets will be acquired from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/) and each one of them contains info of around 10k apps. The info includes name of the apps, category, rating, size, etc.

### Real world Application
Our results give hints to app developers on how they should manage resources and optimize the app when it comes to different platforms. Also, this might be helpful to some customers wishing to find apps with great price performance ratio.
